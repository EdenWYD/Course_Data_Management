    "# Project 03 - Due Monday, November 19 at 1pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objectives*: Use Spark to process and perform basic analysis on non-relational data, including its DataFrame and SQL interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with Python code, SQL queries, shell commands, and markdown cells.  The notebook itself should be completely reproducible (using AWS EC2 instance based on the provided AMI) from start to finish; another person should be able to use the code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Attestation*: **Work in groups**.  At the end of your submitted notebook, identify the work each partner performed and attest that each contributed substantially to the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deadline*: Monday, November 19, 1pm.  One member of each group must submit your notebook to Blackboard; you should not submit it separately."

To keep it \"interesting\", add a filter that removes at least 10 common stop words found in tweets, like \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", and \"RT\" (you might want to derive these stop words from initial results).  To split lines into words, a simple split on text whitespace like we had in class is sufficient; you do not have to account for punctuation.\n",

For example, are they more frequently used by Dodgers or Red Sox fans, or by people in one part of the country over another?  Explore and see what you can find, and discuss your findings.\n",
